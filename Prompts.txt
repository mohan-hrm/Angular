This time it is little better, again the problem is there
it loads static text
Preclinical Study Management System
Active Studies
ID	Study Code	Title	Phase	Start Date	Status

in console it throws these errors 
Failed to load resource: 4200/assets/mock/studies.json:1  the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)

study-list.ts:35 Error loading studies: 
HttpErrorResponse
error	@	study-list.ts:35

studies.json is present in D:\mohan\career building\project\Angular\preclinical-study-management\src\assets\mock\studies.json
